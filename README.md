# Vibe Laser

A laser logic puzzle for the browser. Place mirrors, prisms, filters and other optical parts on a grid until colored laser beams hit every coin in exactly its color. The game is inspired by Aargon Deluxe (Twilight Games, 2001); its rules are rebuilt from a written specification, with our own name, art and levels.

## Branches and pull requests

- Every feature or fix gets its own branch off `origin/main`, named `feature/<name_in_snake_case>` or `fix/<name_in_snake_case>`.
- Each branch gets one pull request against `main`. Nobody pushes to `main` directly.
- A pull request is merged once CI is green.

## Changelog and versions

- `CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Changes that players can see go under `## [Unreleased]`, in `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed` or `### Removed`, written in English for players.
- Changes only developers notice, such as tests, tooling or refactoring, need no entry.
- A version is made only when asked. The entries under `## [Unreleased]` then move to a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section, `package.json` gets the same version, and the commit is tagged `vx.y.z`. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
