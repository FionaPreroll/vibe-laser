 * - Installing keeps every file in a cache named after the worker's scope and the version,
 *   fetched past the browser's HTTP cache so that no file of an older version slips in.
 * - Activating removes older versions of this scope only: on a shared origin such as
 *   github.io, other sites' caches stay. It then takes over pages that are already open.
 * - Requests inside the scope come from the cache, page loads get index.html, and anything
 *   else goes to the network. Lookups ignore Vary headers: servers such as Vite's vary on the
 *   Origin header, which the game's own module requests carry and the worker's did not.
 * - A new version waits until the page asks it to take over, which the game does when the
 *   player chooses to reload.
